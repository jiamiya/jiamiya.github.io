# About Me

My name is Mingyang Jiang, and I am a second-year master's student at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include robot learning, motion planning, and autonomous navigation, with a particular focus on integrating learning-based methods into robotic systems. I earned my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the same school, graduating with strong academic performance.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ming Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TCYA3YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at the [CyberC3 Intelligent Vehicle Lab](https://cyberc3.sjtu.edu.cn/) (in Chinese). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Songan Zhang](https://gift.sjtu.edu.cn/zsa_en/main.htm) from the Global Institute of Future Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

You can find my CV here: [Mingyang Jiang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
